# intro-to-migrations

One of the goals of AR is to remove the need to actually write SQL. So initially there were little scripts to ruby-ify the CREATE stuff. Then people realized (and show this!) that if you wanted to add a column to an already existing DB or a new table or whatever you needed to be able to write just a bit more ruby. But what if you needed to actually change a column? sometimes it was easy, but sometimes it's hard. for example switching a datatype from string to datetime. You actually need to write ruby code to parse the string into a datetime, then save the datetime. So Migrations allowed you to write ruby code as well as the SQL statements. Last, developers wanted a way to track database schema chagnes that worked easily with version control. So each migration is just a list of changes. When you apply all of the migrations at once you get a correct databse, but you can remove or rollback any specific one
